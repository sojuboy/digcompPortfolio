        <p>Inspired by 1990-2010s web aesthetics, aka the Old Web, and the uninhibited individualism found in websites from that time, I created a page similar to a modern “timeline cleanse” meme, but targeted towards computer malware.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">The cultivation of a creative mindset is pivotal to one’s success in numerous aspects of life. Through the creation of a welcoming and understanding workshop environment, my ability to communicate with my peers is prioritized, and an openness to learn from them commences. Through this, I am inspired to produce new ways of thinking, therefore nurturing my problem-solving skills. Fueling creativity drives my desire to learn. By thinking outside the box, I am propelled to become innovative with my projects and adaptable in the face of problems, thus leading to immense personal growth.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Engaging in a workshop environment provides numerous benefits and generates skills that are integral to the development of success both in school and in the real world. Being able to witness the progress and skill levels of the people around me reaffirms that I am not alone in working to develop my skills. Seeing people with a higher skill level work consistently inspires me to create better projects. While there is the benefit of this environment bringing together like-minded individuals who share a similar aspiring career path, there are also many people who are working towards a different one. This allows me to meet people from various backgrounds and see how our targeted skill development benefits us all. </p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">The nature of this course and the typically more abstract prompts for our projects push me to think deeply about the work I am creating. I think the majority of my work time is spent developing an idea or ideas. I then work through them, trial and error, to see what I can do with my abilities. Throughout each project, I constantly think about what I could have done better in order to move on from mistakes and make each project of higher quality than the last. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Sustained research and the development of skills are essential to both individual and professional growth. The structure of Fuego, a tool we use in class, pushes me to outsource methods to create my envisioned idea. I often look towards W3Schools and StackOverflow forums for inspiration and community guidance when needed. I’ve tried numerous new software programs, like those from Adobe and others such as Ibis Paint X, in order to complete my projects. I’ve also now realized that working with code will always be a learning experience, as there will consistently be something new to try.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Through the structure of this class, I am learning how to utilize opportunities to talk about the work I am creating. I’m developing the skills needed to package my project and introduce it in a concise and engaging manner. Being effective at presenting is integral to one’s success both individually and professionally. Although this is something that I am still working on, I’m excited to continue to get better at it.</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Each of the assignments in this phase were constructed in a way that left the prompts a bit open-ended. There were no constrictions, really, for the content that I created. I think this effectively increased the individuality and expressiveness in all of my projects. I think this fact shows especially in my project for the B-roll challenge. B-roll itself is simply supplemental footage, it’s not necessarily interesting on its own. However, I took the opportunity to explore various editing effects within Premiere Pro in order to add personality to the project. I think the integration with technology and tools in this class also helps promote the creative mindset. Through this class, I was introduced to new tools within the Adobe Suite that immensely increased my capability to produce projects. From using Premiere Pro for the interview and special effects projects, to utilizing Photoshop for my photo essay, I gained a wealth of new knowledge.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout this class, we repeatedly engaged in peer review and feedback-based discussions for numerous in-class projects and for our research for our final projects, as well. I think these discussions were immensely helpful in the evolution of my projects throughout this phase. I had some prior knowledge of the Adobe Suite prior to this class, but many of my classmates displayed high levels of skill that inspired me to better my skills. I especially enjoyed watching the b-roll films my classmates developed, they definitely inspired me to add more creative aspects to my own film. Additionally, through peer discussions, a free exchange of ideas was permitted. I think this allowed me to become more comfortable utilizing the Adobe Suite at a quicker pace than if I were self-teaching the programs. The workshop environment further provided a space for both problem posing and solving. These circumstances were incredibly helpful in my Adobe Suite journey, as a relative amateur.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Once again, I think the unrestricted nature of the assignments really prompted me to consider the creative process more. I had to think critically about each project, and reflect on my capability to create my ideal outcome. There were a few assignments that really made me contemplate this, most notably the photo essay, the b-roll challenge, and the special effects project. For the photo essay especially, I had to really consider my plan of action. It was the first assignment, and really the first time I had to use an Adobe program for a class assignment. As a result of this, this and the following few assignments were much more difficult for me in comparison to the later ones. As we progressed throughout this phase, I became more confident in my abilities and the projects became a bit more manageable. Additionally, being able to view my classmate’s projects definitely pushed me to consider the aesthetic value or my material more. It made me want to create something that looked good, while fulfilling the assignment requirements.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout this phase, I was introduced to and became familiar with various programs from the Adobe Suite. Some were programs that I had never used before, like Adobe Character Animator and Premiere Pro. Others were programs I was a bit more familiar with, like Photoshop and After Effects. These were tools that I utilized for every single project in this phase. I became more and more confident in my ability to use these programs as the assignments progressed. I also often looked to outside learning resources to further develop my skills. I tended to go to YouTube the most often, however I made use of other platforms, such as reddit, as well. I also drew inspiration from the work of others, I often browsed Pinterest or my classmate’s work.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">The in-class discussions really helped me learn how to discuss my work. Being placed in a rotating group of individuals assisted in teaching me how to discuss my project in a concise manner. The rotating aspect of the groups taught me both how to engage my audiences and how to adapt to my audience’s feedback. I realized that knowing my material very well is only one of the most important aspects of a presentation. Time management is also incredibly important, it’s a valuable skill to be able to get your point across within your allotted time. As a result of this, adaptability is also principal to a good presentation.</p>

             <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: left">I think the final project really encompassed factors that helped to foster the creative habits of mind. The openness of the kiosk prompt worked to produce a mindset characterized by curiosity, open-mindedness, and a willingness to take risks. The project really forced me to think outside of the box and pushed me to utilize the skills I’ve honed in this class up until this point. It also required me to explore unconventional ideas, that is to say I had to try to integrate skills that were new to me.</p>

This type of space really embraces trial and error, it helped me foster my skills and increase my adaptability when working on large-scale projects, such as the interactive installation. Working in a workshop not only expanded my technical skills but it also helped to nurture my collaborative spirit and my commitment to continuous improvement. It held a lot of value in the creative exploration for my final project.</p>

          <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
    <p style="text-align: left">Through the interactive installation, I repeatedly engaged with the intricacies and nuances of user interface design. I had to really consider the underlying principles of designing an interface, factors such as appearance, interactivity, usability, behavior, and overall feel of the design. In particular, the touch-based aspect of the project was something I had to heavily deliberate over. Designing for accessibility was a major component of this task, as it plays a pivotal role in the usability of this form of interface.</p>

This class really emphasized the importance of this journey, as our final project was a cumulative display of what we learn throughout the semester. This final project, in particular, pushed me to expand my skill level. I often outsourced information from various platforms such as YouTube, W3Schools, and Stack Overflow. I cultivated several new skills in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, HTML, and CSS for my kiosk interface. I also learned how to use Figma for both the wireframe for my project and to create background images for my kiosk interface.</p>
